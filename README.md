# Buffzilla

Buffzilla is a simple buff reminder addon. You tell it what buff to watch and it reminds you when it's missing.

## Usage
Using `/buffzilla` by itself will bring up the options window. The `watch` command lets you add a spell or a group of spells. The watch command will also accept links from your spellbook. See the examples below to get a feel for it.

```
/buffzilla watch Arcane Brilliance
/buffzilla watch Mage Armor, Molten Armor, Ice Armor
```

The Notifier can be repositioned by right-clicking on the buff icon and dragging it around the screen.
